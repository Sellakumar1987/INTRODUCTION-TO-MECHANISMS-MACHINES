# INTRODUCTION-TO-MECHANISMS-MACHINES

###   A machine consists of a number of parts or bodies. In this chapter, we shall study the mechanisms of the various parts or bodies from which the machine is assembled. This is done by making one of the parts as fixed, and the relative motion of other parts is determined with respect to the fixed parts.

## Kinematics Link or Element
### Each part of a machine, which moves relative to some other parts, is known as Kinematic link or element. A link may consist of several parts, which are rigidly fastened together, so that they do not move relative to one another. A link or element needs not to be a rigid body, but it must be a resistant body. A body is said to be a resistant body if it is capable of transmitting the required forces with negligible deformation. Thus a link should have the following two characteristics

### 1. It should have relative motion.
### 2. It must be a resistant body.

## Types of Links
###   In order to transmit motion, the driver and the follower may be connected by the following three types of links:

###  1. Rigid link. A Rigid link is one, which does not undergo any deformation while transmitting motion. Strictly speaking, rigid links do not exist. However, as the deformation of a connecting rod, crank etc. of a reciprocating steam engine is not appreciable, they can be considered as rigid links.

###   2. Flexible link. A flexible link is one, which is partly deformed in a manner not to affect the transmission of motion. For example, belts, ropes, chains and wires are flexible links and transmit tensile forces only.

###   3. Fluid link. A fluid link is one, which is formed by having a fluid in a receptacle, and the motion is transmitted through the fluid by pressure or compression only, as in the case of hydraulic presses, jacks and brakes.

## Structure

###   It is an assemblage of a number of resistant bodies (known as members) having no relative motion between them and meant for carrying loads having straining action. A railway bridge, a roof, truss, machine frames etc.’ are examples of a structure.

## Kinematics Pair

### The two links or elements of a machine, when in contact with each other, are said to form a pair. If the relative motion between them is completely or successfully constrained (i.e. in a definite direction), the pair is known as Kinematics pair.
### Classification of Kinematics Pairs

### The kinematics pairs may be classified according to the following consideration:

### 1. According to the type of relative motion between the elements. The kinematics pairs according to type of relative motion between the elements may be classified as discuss below:
###   (a)	Sliding pair. When the two elements of a pair are connected in such a way that one can only slide relative to the other, the pair is known as a sliding pair. The piston and cylinder, cross-head and guides of a reciprocating steam engine, ram and its guides in shape, tail stock on the lathe bed etc. are the examples of a sliding pair. A little consideration will show that a sliding pair has a completely constrained motion.
###   (b)	Turning point. When the two elements of a pair are connected in such a way that one can only turn or revolve about a fixed axis of another link, the pair is known as turning pair. A shaft with collars at both ends fitted into a circular hole, the crankshaft in a journal bearing in an engine, lathe spindle supported in head stock, cycle wheels turning over their axles etc. are the examples of a turning pair. A turning pair also has a completely constrained motion.
###   (c)		Rolling pair. When the two elements of a pair are connected in such a way that one rolls over another fixed link, the pair is known as rolling pair. Ball and other bearings are examples of rolling pairs.
###   (d)	Screw pair. When the two elements of a pair are connected in such a way that one element can turn about the other by screw threads, the pair is known as screw pair. The lead screw of a lathe with nut, and bolt with a nut are examples of a screw pair.
###   (e)	Spherical pair. When the two elements of a pair are connected in such a way that one element (with spherical shape) turns or swivels about the other fixed element, the pair formed is called a spherical pair. The ball and socket joint, attachment of a car mirror, pen stand etc., are examples of a spherical pair.

### 2. According to the types of contact between the elements. The kinematics pairs according to the type of contact between the elements may be classified as discussed below:
###   (a)	Lower pair. When the two elements of a pair have a surface contact when relative motion takes place and the surface of one-element slides over the surface of the other, the pair formed is known as the lower pair.
###   (b)	Higher pair. When the two elements of a pair have a line or point contact when relative motion takes place and the motion between the two elements is partly turning and partly sliding, then the pair is known as higher pair. A pair of friction discs, toothed gearing, belt and rope drives; ball and roller bearings and cam and follower are the examples of higher pair.

### 3.	According to the type of closure. The kinematics pairs according to the types of closure between the elements may be classified as discussed below:
### (a)	Self closed pair. When the two elements of a pair are connected together mechanically in such a way that only required kind of relative motion occurs, it is then known as self-closed pair. The lower pairs are self-closed pairs.
### (b)		Force-closed pair. When the two elements of a pair are not connected mechanically but are kept in contact by the action of external forces, the pair is said to be a force-closed pair. The cam and follower is an example of force closed pair, as it is kept in contact by the forces exerted by spring and gravity.

## Kinematics Chain
###   When the kinematics pairs are coupled in such a way that the last links is joined to the first link to transmit definite motion (i.e. completely or successfully constrained motion),it is called a kinematics chain. In other words, a kinematics chain may be defined as a combination of kinematics pairs, joined in such a way that each link forms a part of two pairs and the relative motion between the links or elements is completely or successfully constrained. For example, the crankshaft of an engine forms a kinematics pair with the bearing which are fixed in a pair, the connecting rod with the crank forms a second kinematics pair, the piston with the connecting rod forms a third pair and the piston with the cylinder forms a fourth pair. The total combination of these links is a kinematics chain.

###   If each link is assumed to form two pairs with two adjacent links, then the relation between the number of pairs (p) forming a kinematic chain and the number of links (L) May be expressed in the form of an equation:
###     L = 2p – 4

###   Since in a kinematic chain each link forms a part of two pairs, therefore there will be as many links as the number of pairs.

###  Another relation between the number of links (l) and the number of joints (j) which constitute a kinematic chain is given by the expression:
###   J = 3L -2 2

## Mechanism
### When one of the links of a kinematics chain is fixed, the chain is known as a mechanism. It may be used for transmitting or transforming motion e.g. engine indicators, typewriter etc. A mechanism with four links is known as a simple mechanism and the mechanism with more than four links as a compound mechanism. When a mechanism is required to transmit power or to do some particular type of work, it then becomes a machine. In such cases, the various links or elements have to be designed to withstand the forces (both static and kinetic) safely. A little consideration will show that a mechanism may be regarded as a machine in which each part is reduced to the simplest form to transmit the required motion.
